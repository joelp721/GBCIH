        <h1>About UNT Student Connect</h1>
        <p>At UNT Student Connect, we bridge the gap between students and campus life. We're dedicated to streamlining communication, optimizing schedules, and boosting campus involvement through our comprehensive web platform.</p>
        
        <h2>Development Journey</h2>
        <p>Our journey began with a clear goal: to make campus life more accessible and manageable for UNT students. Using tools like Visual Studio Code and draw.io, and programming with HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript, we've crafted an application that's intuitive and easy to use on both Windows and MacOS systems.</p>
        
        <h2>Our Process</h2>
        <p>Our team, comprising Joel Perez, Albert Kileo, Violett Tidwell, and Jakob Dumke, follows a structured project schedule with regular check-ins and milestones ranging from initial design to final launch. We collaborate through OneDrive, Microsoft Teams, and other communication channels to stay aligned and overcome challenges together.</p>
        
        <h2>Get Involved</h2>
        <p>If you're a UNT student looking to get connected, manage your time better, and dive into the full college experience, join us. UNT Student Connect is here to welcome you to a world of possibilities.</p>
